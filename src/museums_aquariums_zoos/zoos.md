## [San Diego Safari Park](https://www.sdzsafaripark.org/)

This is a second park run by the San Diego zoo but it in a completely different location. The main feature here are vehicle based tours of large, free range exhibits simulating the asian savanna and african plains.

The park entrance fee includes the a ride on a tram that goes through the African plains. The ride takes approximately 30 minutes. There are usually long lines for this tram so it is a good idea to get to the park when it opens and walk directly to the tram on entry to the park.

When you buy a ticket they will ask if you'd like to buy safari tours. These are either upgrade options on the Africa area or Asia area. The upgraded experience will get you closer to the animals and in a smaller vehicle.

In addition to the safari experiences the park has zoo exhibits and some animal shows. The shows are good so I recommend you plan your day to see them.

Make sure you stop by the Lorikeet Landing. It's a unique experience where you enter the aviary and fee the colorful birds from your hands. Make sure you bring some cash to buy some the bird food. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qANjdt4X9nY" target="_blank">Lorikeet Landing on YouTube</a>
