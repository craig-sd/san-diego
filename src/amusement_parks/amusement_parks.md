Similar vibe to Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. Fun for the kids but money spends quick. They have rides and rollercoasters that you can buy tickets to one-by-one, or you can get a day pass. There are other activties like a rock wall, miniature golf, an escape room, etc.

The full list of rides and activities is [here](https://www.belmontpark.com/ride-play/)

### Cost

Parking and entry is free. You can buy rides individually or you can get an unlimited pass for the carnival rides is ~$31~ $56 and ~$21~ $46 (less than 48").

The park features sea animal shows and also has roller coasters. In my opinion the San Diego zoos are a better price and a better experience. If you had to choose one animal experience in San Diego I would choose one of those. If you are specifically interested in the marine life shows, then this is your place.

### Shows

* Orca Encounter: a show highlighting the park's killer whales and various aspects of their lives.
* Dolphin Days: guests can meet the Whale & Dolphin family and learn what inspires their trainers.
* Sea Lions Live: a show that spoofs television shows and music, featuring California sea lions and Asian small-clawed otters.
* Sea Rescue: an indoor theater that shows episodes of ABC's Sea Rescue about SeaWorld efforts saving injured marine animals.

### Roller costers

* Electric Eel: Electric Eel is currently the tallest and fastest roller coaster in San Diego. Electric Eel stands at 150 feet tall, with a track length of 853 feet and speeds of up to 62 miles per hour.
* Journey to Atlantis: The ride stands at a height of 95 feet and contains three drops and an elevator lift. In addition, the ride hits a max speed of 42 mph.

* Manta: Manta begins with 270 degree projected media experience at the first launch. The train rocks forward and backward in synchronization with the projected film of a coral reef and school of rays.
