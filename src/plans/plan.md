## Sunday

### Afternoon
I was thinking we could hang out at the house in the afternoon and have lunch at either the Sky Deck or One Paseo. Both are nice places to walk around and have various eating options.

### Dinner
We will make dinner and eat in the backyard. I was thinking of BBQ and a salad and maybe ordering some sides.

### Evening Walk
At 6:45 pm I would like to go to [Torrey Pines beach and walk](../outdoors/walks_and_hikes/#beach-walk) on the beach to flat rock. Unfortunately the tide is at +4.4 at that time so I'll have to see if our path will be restricted.

### Evening
Make smores.

## Monday

### Breakfast
I can make eggs and french toast. Alternatively we can go to [Broken Yolk](https://www.thebrokenyolkcafe.com/menu/main-menu/) but we need to decide this in advance and reserve a table. At broken yolk I recommend their Sope Benedict: Two extra thick and crispy corn tortillas filled with shredded beef and topped with poached eggs, homemade ranchero sauce, sliced avocado, fresh salsa, cotija cheese and sour cream.

### Afternoon
In my opinion the beaches up north where we live are nicer and less tourists than down south. This may be a good day to chill at [Moonlight beach](../outdoors/ocean/#moonlight-state-beach) until your check-in time.

If you want to do a hike I recommend the Torrey Pines Extension since it is nice and well known to tourists.

If you want to do a walk I'd recommend parking on 5th street in Del Mar, carefully cross the train tracks, and walk along the tracks south until you get to the path of purple flowers.
