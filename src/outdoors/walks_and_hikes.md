3 mi and 1125 ft

Nestled into a quiet neighborhood at the eastern fringes of Poway is a hiking trail that goes through the riparian habitat of Poway Creek, rises steeply up into chaparral slopes, and culminates at a panoramic viewpoint known as Goat Peak. Likely known by locals for years, this trail stays largely under the radar for most everyone else. It provides a shorter alternative to the nearby Iron Mountain with far less of that summitâ€™s crowds. Despite coming in at just over three miles, there are sections of trail steep enough to challenge even the seasoned hiker. Goat Peak can be hiked any time of year.

## Mount Laguna

There are a number of nice trails on Mount Laguna. You can review the list [here](https://www.alltrails.com/us/california/mount-laguna). There are beautiful meadows that are quite large. Mount Laguna is also home to one of the best mountain bike trails in Southern California, Noble Canyon. You can also hike Nobel Canyon trail but watch out for bikes coming quickly down the hill.

## [Torrey Pines State Reserve](https://www.sandiego.org/articles/parks-gardens/torrey-pines-state-natural-reserve-park.aspx)

![Torrey Pines](https://www.oceanlight.com/stock-photo/broken-hill-sunrise-clearing-storm-clouds-torrey-pines-photo-29416-345.jpg)

Nice place to take a short hike. Beautiful views of the ocean and erosion making interesting designs in the sandstone.

You can see some nice views with anything from a [5 minute walk](#5-minute-walk-to-views) or a [2.4 mile hike up the hill and back on the beach](#beach-loop). Or, if it's low tide, you can stick to the beach and take anywhere from a 5-11 mile walk on the beach.

They charge for parking but we have a free parking pass for one car if you want to borrow it and go.

### 5 minute walk to views

Use our annual pass to park at the top of the hill and walk out to see the views from above.

### Beach loop

![Road](../images/TorreyPinesReserveRoad.png)
![Beach loop](../images/torrey-pines-state-natural-reserve.jpg)

Walk up a fairly steep paved road to the top of the hill to enjoy beautiful views as you explore the trail and its offshoots the eventually lead down the the beach. Then walk back to the car along the beach.

### Beach Walk

![Torrey pines beach](../images/Torrey-Pines-Flat-Rock.jpg)
![Torrey pines beach](../images/Flat-Rock-beach-Torrey-Pines-State-Beach.jpg)

Walk up to 11 miles on the beach assuming the tide is low enough. We normally walk about 5 miles from Torrey Pines State Park until we get to the nude beach then turn around and go back. [This article](https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2017/mar/01/roam-la-jolla-shores-beach-torrey-pines/) describe a longer route in the reverse direction.

A fun place to stop with the kids that has goats, birds, a big, a tortoise, and koi tanks. It's just a nursery that also has animals to see but makes for a fun stop when you are in Encinitas. The koi fish are a different business on the same location. You can spend up to 30 min here.
