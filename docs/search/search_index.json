The seadragon exhibit is very nice. This aquarium will take approximately a half day to enjoy. Cost \u00b6 Adults $16.50 Kids $12.00 Closed for Covid Natural History Museum \u00b6 Wonderful museum with live animals, kid friendly exhibits, fossils, and cool stuff from their 8 million research specimens. This museum is in Balboa park so you can spend half a day here and the rest of the day doing something else in Balboa park. Cost \u00b6 Museum month prices: $20 adults and $12 kids (3-17) Closed for Covid San Diego Zoo \u00b6 One of the best zoos in the US. This 100-acre animal park has more than 4000 animals representing 800+ species. Plan on spending the entire day here. Park map 2920 Zoo Dr, San Diego, CA 92101 Cost \u00b6 $60 adults, $50 kids, free parking Discounts available: I may be able to get one person in free. San Diego Safari Park \u00b6 This is a second park run by the San Diego zoo but it in a completely different location. The main feature here are vehicle based tours of large, free range exhibits simulating the asian savanna and african plains. The park entrance fee includes the a ride on a tram that goes through the African plains. The ride takes approximately 30 minutes. There are usually long lines for this tram so it is a good idea to get to the park when it opens and walk directly to the tram on entry to the park. When you buy a ticket they will ask if you'd like to buy safari tours. These are either upgrade options on the Africa area or Asia area. The upgraded experience will get you closer to the animals and in a smaller vehicle. In addition to the safari experiences the park has zoo exhibits and some animal shows. The shows are good so I recommend you plan your day to see them. Make sure you stop by the Lorikeet Landing. It's a unique experience where you enter the aviary and fee the colorful birds from your hands. Make sure you bring some cash to buy some the bird food. Lorikeet Landing on YouTube Park map 15500 San Pasqual Valley Rd, Escondido, CA 92027 Cost \u00b6 $60 adults, $50 kids, $15 parking Discounts available: I may be able to get one person in free. Sea World \u00b6 The park features sea animal shows and also has roller coasters. In my opinion the San Diego zoos are a better price and a better experience. If you had to choose one animal experience in San Diego I would choose one of those. If you are specifically interested in the marine life shows, then this is your place. Shows \u00b6 Orca Encounter: a show highlighting the park's killer whales and various aspects of their lives. Dolphin Days: guests can meet the Whale & Dolphin family and learn what inspires their trainers. Sea Lions Live: a show that spoofs television shows and music, featuring California sea lions and Asian small-clawed otters. Sea Rescue: an indoor theater that shows episodes of ABC's Sea Rescue about SeaWorld efforts saving injured marine animals. Roller costers \u00b6 Electric Eel: Electric Eel is currently the tallest and fastest roller coaster in San Diego. Electric Eel stands at 150 feet tall, with a track length of 853 feet and speeds of up to 62 miles per hour. Journey to Atlantis: The ride stands at a height of 95 feet and contains three drops and an elevator lift. In addition, the ride hits a max speed of 42 mph. Emperor: With a height of 153 ft, Emperor will be the tallest, fastest and longest Dive Coaster in California. The ride will contain 2500 feet of track, an immelman loop, 143 foot tall 90 degree drop and will reach speeds over 60 miles per hour. Manta: Manta begins with 270 degree projected media experience at the first launch. The train rocks forward and backward in synchronization with the projected film of a coral reef and school of rays. The two-minute, 2,800-foot (850 m) long ride stands at a height of 30 feet (9.1 m) and features a drop of 54 feet (16 m). The layout is characterized by multiple turns, short but sudden drops and crossovers. Tidal Twister: The ride reaches a top speed of 30 miles per hour, with a height of 22 feet and a track length of 320 feet.
