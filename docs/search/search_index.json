Sea World \u00b6 The park features sea animal shows and also has roller coasters. In my opinion the San Diego zoos are a better price and a better experience. If you had to choose one animal experience in San Diego I would choose one of those. If you are specifically interested in the marine life shows, then this is your place. Shows \u00b6 Orca Encounter: a show highlighting the park's killer whales and various aspects of their lives. Dolphin Days: guests can meet the Whale & Dolphin family and learn what inspires their trainers.

Emperor: With a height of 153 ft, Emperor will be the tallest, fastest and longest Dive Coaster in California.

There are usually long lines for this tram so it is a good idea to get to the park when it opens and walk directly to the tram on entry to the park. When you buy a ticket they will ask if you'd like to buy safari tours. These are either upgrade options on the Africa area or Asia area.

Goat Mountain \u00b6 3 mi and 1125 ft Nestled into a quiet neighborhood at the eastern fringes of Poway is a hiking trail that goes through the riparian habitat of Poway Creek, rises steeply up into chaparral slopes, and culminates at a panoramic viewpoint known as Goat Peak. Likely known by locals for years, this trail stays largely under the radar for most everyone else. It provides a shorter alternative to the nearby Iron Mountain with far less of that summit\u2019s crowds. Despite coming in at just over three miles, there are sections of trail steep enough to challenge even the seasoned hiker. Goat Peak can be hiked any time of year. Details Directions \u00b6 (Poway) From I-15, exit on Poway Road and go east for 5 miles. Just as Poway Road curves left (north), turn right onto Garden Road and continue 1.6 miles to Quiet Valley Lane. Turn right (east) and go 0.1 mile to the end of the road and park (there is room for several vehicles around the cul-de-sac). No facilities. Map Mount Laguna \u00b6 There are a number of nice trails on Mount Laguna. You can review the list here . There are beautiful meadows that are quite large. Mount Laguna is also home to one of the best mountain bike trails in Southern California, Noble Canyon. You can also hike Nobel Canyon trail but watch out for bikes coming quickly down the hill. Current closures (see recreation conditions report) Cost \u00b6 You will need a Cleveland National Forest pass that you can buy here for $5.

Beautiful views of the ocean and erosion making interesting designs in the sandstone. You can see some nice views with anything from a 5 minute walk or a 2.4 mile hike up the hill and back on the beach . Or, if it's low tide, you can stick to the beach and take anywhere from a 5-11 mile walk on the beach. They charge for parking but we have a free parking pass for one car if you want to borrow it and go. 5 minute walk to views \u00b6 Use our annual pass to park at the top of the hill and walk out to see the views from above. Beach loop \u00b6 Walk up a fairly steep paved road to the top of the hill to enjoy beautiful views as you explore the trail and its offshoots the eventually lead down the the beach. Then walk back to the car along the beach. Details Beach Walk \u00b6 Walk up to 11 miles on the beach assuming the tide is low enough. We normally walk about 5 miles from Torrey Pines State Park until we get to the nude beach then turn around and go back. This article describe a longer route in the reverse direction. Sunshine Gardens \u00b6 A fun place to stop with the kids that has goats, birds, a big, a tortoise, and koi tanks.

Monday \u00b6 Breakfast \u00b6 I can make eggs and french toast. Afternoon \u00b6 In my opinion the beaches up north where we live are nicer and less tourists than down south.

If you want to do a walk I'd recommend parking on 5 th street in Del Mar, carefully cross the train tracks, and walk along the tracks south until you get to the path of purple flowers. View from tracks in Del Mar Places to Hang out \u00b6 One Paseo - Fancy outdoor shopping center next to our house. Nice place to stroll, chill, talk. https://www.instagram.com/onepaseo/ Sky Deck at Del Mar Highlands - In the shopping center next to our house (across the street from One Paseo) there is another outdoor mall, Del Mar Heighlands. There is a new eatery there called the Sky Deck that has a few restaurants open. Do to the Sky Deck on the top floor and look out over the nice view and order a hard kombucha flight from Booch Craft. If you are hungry order Greek food or a pizza. Modern Times Beer Tasting Room - OK, I don't get out much and I don't like IPA so take this recommendation with a grain of salt. I like the vibe of this place. If you are at my house you can go to the one in Encinitas. If you are at the other house you can go in North Park. Karl Strauss Restaurant in Sorrento Mesa - Yes, another beer place... see above. This place is a nice place to talk and have a beer. Beer, beer food, and japanese garden. More Viewpoint Brewing - OK, I like beer I just want some dopplebock options. Anyway, this brewery is near my house and has a nice view of the lagoon and the Del Mar Racetrack. Go during a race and they will have the races on the screens. They also have nice fire features and corn hole. Check out the website to see the nice animation showing the surroundings. Family Fun Center - Mini-golf and go-carts. website Restaurants \u00b6 Convoy street - Cluster of asian restaurants and other businesses. It's fun to go there, pick out a place, and enjoy. Some good options described here . If you go here we recommend you have desert at Somisomi (Nutella inside) or MNGO cafe #mngocafe . Breakfast Restaurants \u00b6 Morning Glory - Beautiful brunch in Little Italy. See the review . Day Trips \u00b6 Palomar Mountain - Temecula (Wine Country) - An hour drive to our wine country.

This may be a good day to chill at Moonlight beach until your check-in time. If you want to do a hike I recommend the Torrey Pines Extension since it is nice and not full of tourists. If you want to do a walk I'd recommend parking on 5 th street in Del Mar, carefully cross the train tracks, and walk along the tracks south until you get to the path of purple flowers. View from tracks in Del Mar","title":"Afternoon"},{"location":"plans/plan/#places-to-hang-out","text":"One Paseo - Fancy outdoor shopping center next to our house. Nice place to stroll, chill, talk. https://www.instagram.com/onepaseo/ Sky Deck at Del Mar Highlands - In the shopping center next to our house (across the street from One Paseo) there is another outdoor mall, Del Mar Heighlands. There is a new eatery there called the Sky Deck that has a few restaurants open. Do to the Sky Deck on the top floor and look out over the nice view and order a hard kombucha flight from Booch Craft. If you are hungry order Greek food or a pizza. Modern Times Beer Tasting Room - OK, I don't get out much and I don't like IPA so take this recommendation with a grain of salt. I like the vibe of this place. If you are at my house you can go to the one in Encinitas. If you are at the other house you can go in North Park. Karl Strauss Restaurant in Sorrento Mesa - Yes, another beer place... see above. This place is a nice place to talk and have a beer. Beer, beer food, and japanese garden. More Viewpoint Brewing - OK, I like beer I just want some dopplebock options. Anyway, this brewery is near my house and has a nice view of the lagoon and the Del Mar Racetrack. Go during a race and they will have the races on the screens. They also have nice fire features and corn hole. Check out the website to see the nice animation showing the surroundings.
